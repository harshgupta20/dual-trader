# üìà DualTrader ‚Äì Trade Both Sides with Ease

**DualTrader** is a lightweight PWA (Progressive Web App) that enables traders to **buy and sell the same equity/futures/options simultaneously** using **two separate Kite (Zerodha) accounts** ‚Äî one for buying and one for selling. This makes it possible to execute more advanced strategies like **straddles, strangles, hedges, or volatility-based trades** which are **not possible using a single broker account due to restrictions**.

---

## üöÄ Why DualTrader?

Traditional brokers restrict users from placing simultaneous buy and sell orders for the same security under the same account. This limits traders who wish to:

- **Create delta-neutral or volatility strategies**
- **Simultaneously hedge their positions**
- **Test opposing market predictions (e.g., breakout vs. breakdown)**

**DualTrader** provides a solution by allowing users to log in with **two separate Kite accounts** (e.g., personal and family/friend account) and seamlessly trade both sides of the same instrument.
